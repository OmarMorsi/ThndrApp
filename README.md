## Features

- Implemented two screens: one for the native splash screen and another for the Tickers list screen.
- Fetched the endpoint to retrieve all the tickers and listed them in a ScrollView.
- Implemented a search bar input that returns the items being searched for and serves as a parameter for the endpoint.
- Created a unit test for UI verification and another for the endpoint.
- Added images/icons instead of those retrieved from the Ticker Details v3 endpoint, which fetches a single ticker.
- Checked the responsiveness of the app across all devices, ensuring it loads correctly without any errors.

## Improvements

- Add unit tests for the codebase.
- Use the icon_URL instead of a random Image for each Ticker.
- Enhance the search bar fetching method, making it more dynamic.
- Use Redux for better management of the app.
- Enhance the design even to be user-friendly even more.
